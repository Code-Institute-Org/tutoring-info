                        <p>A tutoring session is an active learning experience in which you will not only fix your code,
                            but learn new career skills while doing so.</p>
                        <p>Students who engage in tutoring progress more quickly through the course than those who
                            don't, and are more likely to succeed.</p>
                        <p>Tutors can help you to understand course concepts that you're unclear on, interpret
                            documentation and error messages, and develop troubleshooting skills that will prove
                            invaluable in the industry.</p>
                        <p>Tutors will teach you how to resolve your issues, rather than fixing them for you. Please do
                            not enter a tutoring session with the expectation of an easy fix - the learning process can
                            be long and difficult, but will be worth it in the end.</p>
                        <p>With that in mind, tutors will frequently ask students to carry out various tasks. Students
                            are expected to actively participate in these tasks as they constitute the majority of the
                            learning experience (i.e. learn by doing). The active collaboration required in tutoring sessions means that tutoring will only be delivered through online IDEs, not local IDEs.</p>

                                <p><b>Your Problem Statement</b></p>
                                <p>A general statement like <i>"my project isn't working"</i> is not conducive to a
                                    successful tutoring session.<br>
                                    A good problem statement contains two things - a concise description of your issue,
                                    and the steps you've taken so far to try to resolve it.<br>
                                    Start by asking yourself <i>why</i> your project isn't working. The following is an
                                    example of a well-formed problem statement:<br>
                                    <i>I have written a CSS rule which should make all of the images on my index.html
                                        200px wide. I have imported the CSS file at the top of index.html, but the style
                                        is not being applied.<br>
                                        I have tried examining the page using the browser's dev tools in order to see
                                        what the issue might be, but I can't seem to figure it out. The styles aren't
                                        listed in there either!</i>
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-12 col-md-6 text-left">
                                <p><b>Your Own Debugging/Research</b></p>
                                <p>At the simplest level, if your code doesn't work, and you can't fix it, the goal is
                                    to learn <i>how</i> to fix it.<br>
                                    However, as we've already seen, a well written problem statement is more detailed
                                    than my code doesn't work. A specific part of your code doesn't work, and it will
                                    involve its own specific troubleshooting process.<br>
                                    In order for us to ascertain what you have done so far, and where the gaps in your
                                    understanding lie, we need to see evidence of the research and debugging that you
                                    have carried out so far. This may include information on Google searches, Slack
                                    searches, or links to StackOverflow questions or other resources that you have
                                    found. You should never enter a tutoring session without having spent at least 15
                                    minutes researching the problem by yourself.

                        <p><b>Patience</b></p>
                        <p>Troubleshooting is a process. It is sometimes a very long process. It is always a very
                            repetitive process.<br>
                            In the software world, it can take days to track down and fix a single bug. You're unlikely
                            to encounter anything quite so complex here, but on occasion, tutoring sessions can take
                            longer than you'd expect or involve a considerable amount of drudgery. This is a core part
                            of programming, and cannot be avoided.</p>
                        <p><b>Usage</b></p>
                        <p>The average student uses about 30 minutes of tutoring per week.<br>
                            Your access to tutoring will be capped at 90 minutes per week, in order to ensure fair
                            access to all students.<br>
                            If you reach the cap in any given week, you will be assigned steps to help you continue
                            with your work while relying less on tutoring.

                                    <li>That no one student will be given preferential treatment over any other
                                        students. Please note that students with very high tutoring usage will be queued
                                        in order to allow for fair access to all students - queued students will always
